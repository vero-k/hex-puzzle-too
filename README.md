A React-Fiber Three-Powered Game

Introduction

This frontend application is built with React and powered by React Fiber Three for 3D rendering. 


Game Overview

This game allows users to upload an image that serves as the base for a puzzle. The backend application processes this image by overlaying an isohedral grid of regular hexagons. Each hexagon is then transformed into a separate image, undergoing zero to some various operations like blurring, rotation, and color modifications. The player's objective is to reassemble and rectify these modified hexagons to recreate the original image

Project Status

This project is currently a work in progress. We are actively developing new features and making improvements. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!
Features

    Image Upload: Users can upload an image of their choice to start the game.
    Dynamic Image Processing: The backend applies a grid of hexagons to the image and performs random operations on each segment.
    Interactive 3D Rendering: Utilizing React Fiber Three, the game offers a 3D experience.
    Puzzle Gameplay: Players rearrange and modify hexagons to match the original image.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
